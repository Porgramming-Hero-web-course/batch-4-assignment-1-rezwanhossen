<!-- Union type and intersection type are two very important in Typescript which make the management of our code easier. We will discuss how to use both of these and their requirements.
Union type:
With union type we can select any one type from multiple types. In programming language, inside the if condition we used to say that if one value is not correct, the other will be or else. Here union type and same works.
Why do we use union type?
Here we can define multiple types in the same variable through union type. This means that instead of using one type, we can use multiple types in the same variable.
For example:
Let value: string | number | boolean
Value="hello";
Value=12;
Value=true;
Here value variability string number can be boolean type if any other type then error will be shown.
Here we can add multiple types by using ( | ) symbol. Out of which any one type can be adopted.

Intersection type:
Using Intersection type we can combine two or more types to create a new type. In other programming languages, we used end between ifs to equal two values, here the intersection type does the same thing.
For example:
Type intersectionType =type1 & type2 & type3
Here using this symbol type on type two and type three types all properties can be found together.
For example:
Type person={name : string}
Type employee={employeID: number}
Type staff = person & employee
const staffMember: staff={
name:"raj",
employeeID:123
}
Difference between Union and intersection types:
Union:
1. Select any one type from multiple types
2. It is used when working with different types of data.
Intersection:
1. The properties of multiple types are combined to form a new type.
2. It is used when more than one type of attribute is needed together. -->

## Union Type and Intersection Type in TypeScript

Union types and intersection types are two very important features in TypeScript that help in managing the code more efficiently. In this section, we will discuss how to use both of these types and their use cases.

### **Union Type:**

A union type allows you to specify multiple types for a variable, and the variable can take any one of the specified types. It is similar to the logic we use in programming when we say "if one value is incorrect, the other one will be valid," or (`||`) "if one condition fails, another one will succeed." This is essentially what the union type does.

#### **Why do we use union type?**

With the union type, we can define multiple types for the same variable. This means that instead of restricting a variable to one specific type, we can allow multiple types.

#### **Example:**

```typescript
let value: string | number | boolean;
value = "hello"; // valid
value = 12; // valid
value = true; // valid
```

In this example, the `value` variable can be of type `string`, `number`, or `boolean`. If any other type is assigned, TypeScript will show an error.

Here, we are using the `|` (pipe) symbol to combine multiple types. Any one of these types can be chosen for the variable.

### **Intersection Type:**

An intersection type allows you to combine two or more types to create a new type. In other programming languages, we often use the logical **AND** (`&&`) operator to check if multiple conditions are true. Similarly, in TypeScript, the intersection type combines the properties of multiple types into a single new type.

#### **Example:**

```typescript
type Person = { name: string };
type Employee = { employeeID: number };

type Staff = Person & Employee;

const staffMember: Staff = {
  name: "Raj",
  employeeID: 123,
};
```

In this example, the `Staff` type is an intersection of the `Person` and `Employee` types. This means the `staffMember` object must have both `name` and `employeeID` properties.

### **Difference Between Union and Intersection Types:**

| **Feature**      | **Union Type**                             | **Intersection Type**                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **What it does** | Selects any one type from multiple types.  | Combines properties from multiple types to create a new type.      |
| **When to use**  | When working with different types of data. | When you need to combine multiple properties from different types. |
